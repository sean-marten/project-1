# ActorSearch
This repository contains a unique code quiz. It will test the user's knowledge of JavaScript. This quiz is time and allows users to save their high scores after each attempt.

This repository contains a customized actor search web app. This app allows the user to input an actor's name in order to retrieve biographical information about the actor, as well as their top rated movies (don't worry, we also include a youtube trailer for the movie).

## Outline of ActorSearch
This repository has some unique features, which are outlined below:
1. We leverage two different APIs in order to access information about the desired actore when searched.
2. Instead of using boring Bootstrap, we have implemented Material Design for Bootstrap, which is an enhanced CSS framework with developed styling.
3. A sleek and polished UI with fade-in background colors and an artistic backdrop.
4. Well formatted and commented code that is easy to read.
5. Repetitive card stacking with unique movie tiles and youtube trailers.
6. User input validation to notify the user if they haven't input the correct requirements to search.
